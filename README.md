## About

This repository is a collection of machine learning models that I have developed. It includes implementations of algorithms for both supervised and unsupervised learning, as well as deep learning projects. Each model is accompanied by:

- A brief description of the problem it addresses.
- Code for training and evaluation.
- Results and observations (if applicable).

The goal is to share knowledge and provide a reference for machine learning enthusiasts.

## Models

The repository includes the following models:

- **Linear Regression**: Predicting continuous values.
- **Logistic Regression**: Binary classification.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Unsupervised grouping of data.
- **Neural Networks**: Basic deep learning models.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: For image classification tasks.

More models will be added over time.

## How to Use

Each model is contained within its own folder. To use a model:

1. Navigate to the folder of the model you are interested in.
2. Follow the instructions in the accompanying files to run the code.

For questions or issues, feel free to contact me.
