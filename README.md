## About the Repository

This repository is a collection of machine learning models, ranging from simple regression algorithms to more complex neural networks. Each model includes:

- A description of the problem it solves
- The dataset(s) used
- Preprocessing steps
- Model architecture/algorithm
- Training and evaluation metrics

The goal is to create a knowledge base for machine learning practitioners and enthusiasts who want to explore, learn, or utilize these models.

## Implemented Models

### Supervised Learning

- **Linear Regression**: Predicting continuous values (e.g., house prices).
- **Logistic Regression**: Binary classification (e.g., spam detection).
- **Random Forest**: Classification and regression tasks.

### Unsupervised Learning

- **K-Means Clustering**: Segmenting data into distinct groups.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Dimensionality reduction.

### Deep Learning

- **Neural Networks**: Custom architectures for regression and classification.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Image classification and processing.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Time-series forecasting and text generation.
